    * Local optimal point could not be reached, when the learning rate is much bigger than 0.001.
    * The learning is kind of slow when the learning rate is much smaller than 0.1e-6
    * The best learning rate is about 0.1e-3, which is 0.0001.

2. The best learning rate is about 0.0001. The plot could be found in the .ipynb file.
